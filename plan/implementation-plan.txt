Let's start with the backend first since it's the foundation that the frontend will depend on. This approach
  allows us to:

  1. Set up the data structure and API contracts
  2. Create mock data for development
  3. Test the API endpoints before building the frontend
  4. Ensure the aggregation logic works correctly

  Proposed Build Order:

  Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Start Here)

  1. AdonisJS project setup with TypeScript
  2. Basic project structure and configuration
  3. Mock JSON data files for time series and policies
  4. API routes and controllers for metrics and snapshot policies
  5. Data aggregation logic for different time ranges

  Phase 2: Frontend Foundation

  6. NextJS project setup with TypeScript and Tailwind
  7. Basic routing and layout structure
  8. API client setup with Axios and React Query

  Phase 3: Features Implementation

  9. Performance Metrics dashboard with Recharts
  10. Edit Snapshot Policy form with validation
  11. User switching functionality

  Phase 4: Polish & Testing

  12. Error handling and loading states
  13. Responsive design refinements
  14. Unit tests for critical components
